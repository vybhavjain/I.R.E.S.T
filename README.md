Image Retrieval along with Encoded Storage and Tagging

### Using Flask the application performs the following tasks -
1)Exposes a GET request that scrapes images given a keyword.
2)Stores these images locally so that if the keywords repeat, it doesnâ€™t scrape the web again.
3)Using an AI tool it automatically generates descriptive tags for each image. (Imagga API used)
4)Exposes a POST method that takes the byte64 image and its tags and uploads it to a cloud storage (Firebase used)
5)It queries the stored images by a keyword and displays the top 5 relevant images.
